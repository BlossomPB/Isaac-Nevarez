                About Me: <br>
                I am currently a student of UAT that is still learning the basics of coding, and the implications of where to use them. <br> To help me with this I've started a little project that is with Roblox Coding as it is simple, and easier to learn <br>
                than other code. This is because of learning one code can be translated into helping me learn other more advanced coding.
